would like to have a system to display numbers coupled randomly taken from a pool of given numbers, and show it on a screen with a countdown on the bottom lines and a sound coming through every time a new couple of numbers is up


i have this urgent matter to solve and I'm not even sure I listed the correct requirements for it

and for one event I need to organize a scoreboard like in the picture attached to the job description
the thing is that this scoreboard must be animated and the pool of numbers is defined by the guest entrance to the event

?: When the guest entrance, what input do?
How can I define the pool of numbers by the guest entrance to the event?

all this has to come out as a video output from a laptop
so that I can share It on a separate screen
the guests are given a number upon entering the event between 001 and 500
the person doing the check in at the entrance must have a way to insert their number into the system I need to build
they will have an iPad to do so
and after a certain amount of time (ie 10 minutes) their number must come up on the scoreboard attached with a countdown
and in less than 15 minute jump up to the first row

that I have already a video system in place to share different video input, and one of these will be a laptop with this system running on it
so basically I have a laptop dedicated to show this content

and I will connect the laptop to my video management system, displaying the content on other screens

so you have this 2 pages, one with the flaggable list and the other one with the timed output correct ?

and when I flag a number, this number is inserted in a pool of numbers that will be coupled randomly

and they go on the screen after approximately 10 minutes from the flagging, with a count down of 5 minutes

what I am aiming to create is an active waiting list
and I want that when the guests enter the event they are listed to play at these tables
I can't as this is the all point of the event, is to unveil this new product slightly

but I told you to give you the idea of why I have this extra layer of difficulty to randomly have the guests numbers coupled together like in the example shown
cool, please note that the release of the milestones will be linked to the quality of what I can see, as you can imagine
please do as I prefer you asking me questions before than try to recover some job already done

the event will be divided in 4 time slots
and we will have for the 2 days of event 1000 entrance badges numbered from 1 to 1000
for every time slot we are waiting 250 guests
so on the iPad a list of sequential increasing numbers should be ready to be flagged

so let's say on the iPad I have a page with a grid of 250 numbers that can be flagged just pressing on them
so when the hostess welcome the arriving guest delivers a badge with any of these 250 available numbers and flag the one corresponding into the iPad list
and this triggers the system putting in hold the number for 10 minutes
after which the number appears on the screen at the bottom line
and coupled randomly to another guest number marked as arrived on the ipad
when the countdown reaches 4 minutes the number goes up of a row
and so on until it gets to the top of the list, and when it does so, the number flashes or do something visible (TBD) and a sound is released
so that you are prompted to watch the screen and see if your number is up

now the timing is not confirmed and may change, so having a control board where these values can be set would be amazing

to have the guests playing to the football tables randomly, making sure that the rotation to the tables is automatic
the event is huge, divided in many rooms, with screens showing this waiting list
the football tables are in a room we call ARENA
is the planning of how the players should be called at the tables
and the timings we are looking for
you can study what I wrote and come back to me with a list of questions, ok ?
no rush
at least not too much
